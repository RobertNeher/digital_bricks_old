## ⚡ Key Features

### 🔌 Logic Gates
* **Flexible Inputs**: Standard gates (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, NXOR) support 2, 3, 4, or 8 inputs, configurable via context menu.
* **Precision Inversion**: High-speed inverter (NOT) gate.

### ⏱️ Timing
* **Oscillator**: Configurable Oscillator for precise clock signal generation.

### 🖼️ Visualization & I/O
* **Interactive Indicators**: Customizable LEDs (with labels and High/Low colors), 7-segment displays (raw bitwise control with decimal point), and 16-segment displays (ASCII decoding).
* **User Input**: Interactive Buttons (with labels) and Constant Sources.
* **Markdown Support**: Embed documentation directly into your circuit using Markdown components.

### 🔌 Display Pin Layouts

#### 7-Segment Display (Raw Control)
The 7-segment display uses 8 input pins for direct segment control:
```
       a
     f   b
       g
     e   c
       d   (dp)
```
*   **Pins a-g**: Map directly to the segments shown above.
*   **Pin dp**: Controls the decimal point.

#### 16-Segment Display (ASCII Decoder + DP)
The 16-segment display uses 8 input pins:
*   **Pins 1-7 (Top to Bottom)**: Map to bits 6 down to 0 of the ASCII character (0-127).
*   **Pin 8 (Bottom, labeled 'dp')**: Controls the decimal point.
*   **Logic**: Bit 0 of ASCII is at pin 7, bit 1 is at pin 6, etc. Pin 8 is an independent decimal point control.

## 🏗️ Integrated Circuits (Modular Design)

Modularize your designs by creating custom **Integrated Circuits (ICs)**.

### 📦 Blueprints
* **Create**: Select any part of a circuit and save it as a "Blueprint".
* **Reuse**: Blueprints can be dropped onto the canvas as single, compact IC components.
* **Persistence**: Blueprints are stored in `assets/blueprints.json`.

### 🔓 Unpack & Repack
* **Live Inspection**: Right-click an IC and select **Unpack** to expand it into its constituent components on the main canvas.
* **Unpack Limit**: To maintain canvas performance and clarity, **only one circuit can be unpacked at a time**.
* **Smart Repack**: Quickly collapse an expanded circuit back into its IC form. You can trigger a **Repack Parent** action by right-clicking *any* child component of an unpacked circuit, or by using the selection toolbar.

## 🖱️ Interaction & Tools

* **Infinite Canvas**: A massive 10,000 x 10,000 area with a high-precision grid.
* **Smart Connections**: Bezier-curved wires with automatic pin-to-pin snapping.
* **Batch Actions**: Multi-select components to move, align, delete, or repack them as a group.
* **Contextual Control**: Right-click any component to access advanced parameters and settings.
